# MetagenomeAPI
---

A [KBase](https://kbase.us) module generated by the [KBase SDK](https://github.com/kbase/kb_sdk).


## Utility

The MetagenomeAPI is intended as an all around utility for the KBaseMetagenomes object types. It should be used for FrontEnd services and other non-sdk application code to interact with KBaseMetagenomes types.

## Search

The MetagenomeAPI serves as a backend-client for searching features of the `KBaseMetagenomes.AnnotatedMetagenomeAssembly` workspace object. The `search` and `search_region` functions are designed to use the KBase Search2API, where the workspace objects are indexed in _versioned_ documents.

### search
the `search` function uses the following input parameters:
	- ref: `KBaseMetagenomes.AnnotatedMetagenomeAssembly` workspace object reference
    - sort_by: list of tuples by which to sort by, ex: [("elasticsearch ", ascend bool), ...]
    - start: integer start of pagination
    - limit: integer end of pagination

... and returns:
    - query: the query used on the Search2API
    - start: integer index start of pagination
    - features: list of feature information.
    - num_found: the total number of matches with the query (without pagination)


### search_region
the `search_region` function uses the following as input:
	- ref: `KBaseMetagenomes.AnnotatedMetagenomeAssembly` workspace object reference
    - contig_id: id of contig to search .
    - region_start: integer start of contig context to search.
    - region_length: integer lenght of contig context to search.
    - page_start: integer start of pagination
    - page_limit: integer end of pagination
    - sort_by: list of tuples by which to sort by, ex: [("elasticsearch ", ascend bool), ...]

.. and returns:
    - contig_id: id of contig to search around, (same as input).
    - region_start: integer start of contig context to search around, (same as input).
    - region_length: integer lenght of contig context to search around, (same as input).
    - start: integer start of pagination
    - features: list of feature information.
    - num_found: the total number of matches with the query (without pagination)
